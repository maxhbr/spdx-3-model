# NoAssertionText

## Summary

Concrete class representing an absence of an assertion about the presence of
copyright text.

## Description

**TBD** whether these details should be defined in the copyrightText property instead of here

A NoAssertionText is the primary value that is used by a copyrightText field
that indicates that the SPDX data creator is making no assertion about whether
any copyright information is present, or what its contents are if it is
present.

If a copyrightText has a NOASSERTION value, this indicates that one of the
following applies:
* the SPDX data creator has made no attempt to determine this field; or
* the SPDX data creator has intentionally provided no information (no meaning
  should be implied from the absence of an assertion).
